To mark the occasion, <a href="http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/didcot/10652935.Diamond_Light_Source_has_a_beaming_100th_birthday/">Dr John Jenkin, the biographer of the British scientific duo, gave a lecture, while Professor Thomas Sorensen, principal beamline scientist at the science facility, spoke about the importance of X-ray crystallography</a> to modern-day scientists.</p>
